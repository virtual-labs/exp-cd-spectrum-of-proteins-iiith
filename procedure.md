**Step 1 :** The screen shows three steps to Study the effect of Secondary Structure - Selecting Sample and Purge the N2. - Measurement of CD Spectra of the Selected Sample. - Guess the Structure of Sample using the spectra obtained.
click on the 'Start' button to initiate the simulation.

**Step 2 :** There are three buttons "N2 Purge", "Measure CD" and "Secondary Structure".

**Step 3 :** Please select one sample from the drop down menu named "Secondary Structure".

**Step 4 :** One may proceed with "N2 Purge" and see what happens in the screen or directly "Measure CD".

**Step 5 :** If "Measure CD" is selected, then there are a list of instructions to be followed to perform the task. The sample will be taken in special container. The spectrometer's lid needs to opened by click. The sample will be automatically kept inside. Opening and closing of the lid is done by clicking a white oval button below the lid.

**Step 6 :** The spectra of your sample is ready. Click continue to "Identify the secondary structural element" from the spectrum.

**Step 7 :** If the answer does not match with any existing spectra then appropriate result will be shown in screen. Retaking the quiz or Re-doing the experiment is possible at this stage.
