In the previous experiments, we have seen the effect of anisotropic medium on electromagnetic waves. The rationale behind the emergence of the phenomenon of Circular birefringence and Circular Dichroism (CD) from such chiral molecules has clearly been described in the earlier experiments. CD, being an intrinsic property of optically active molecules, can therefore, be used as a method to identify and study the important optically active molecules of nature. One of the most important optically active molecules is a protein molecule which is an essential biomolecule studied extensively across the scientific community. Since, proteins are chiral in nature (due to their dextrorotary and levorotary components), they also exhibit CD. As a consequence, CD can be used as a tool to study these molecules.

In this experiment we will focus on the structure and function of protein molecules and their relationship with CD. As we proceed, we will be able to understand the different structural features of a protein and how do they affect the CD spectrum of proteins. We will see how CD spectroscopy can be used as a method for the characterization of different protein structures. Precisely, this experiment aims to observe and study characterization of protein structures and folds based on its CD spectrum. The capacity of CD to give a representative structural signature makes it a powerful tool in modern biochemistry with applications that can be found in virtually every field of study.
