The purpose of the lab is to give students an idea of the structure of a protein and how CD spectroscopy technique is useful to detect the characteristics of secondary structures of proteins. By performing the experiment a student will

    1. understand the level of complexity of protein structure.

    2. observe CD spectrum of different secondary structures of the protein.

    3. have an idea about the importance of the N2 purging during measuring the CD spectrometer.
