"question": "2. Protein is a polymer. Monomeric unit of which is amino acid. Each amino acid has a chiral center. So is it possible to apply CD spectrum to study the structure of a protein? ", 
"answers": {
            "a":"Yes.", 
            "b":"No.",
            "c":"The given information is not enough. Can not conclude.", 
            "d":"CD spectroscopy may be used for some protein not all." 
            },
"correctAnswer": "a"  },
	   
			  
{
"question":"3. Having known the primary structure of a protein the main interest of biologists is to know the secondary structure of a protein. How a spectroscopic method can help it?",  
"answers": {
            "a":"Response only for a particular secondary structure, for others structures remain silent.", 
            "b":"Give signature spectra for each different secondary structure.", 
            "c":"Spectroscoppic methods can not help.",
	    "d":"can not say."
           },
